# Small customizations for Satoir/Power 9
#
# 1. golang
#    avoid having Spack build golang. Use code that has been downloaded by hand.
#    The bootstrap is a mess with ppcle due to a combination of spack config 
#    files and Google approach of supporting distributing only binaries for later 
#    versions of golang. We want golang so we can use spack to build up to date
#    rclone.
#
# 2. cuda
#    Point to a preinstalled version that was hand installed. The NVidia distribution
#    does not include code for building ppcle.
#
# 3. all
#    Set default compiler as gcc 8.3.0.
#    
#
